		AlphaSense Fintech Case Study
	In a world full of technology there is a company called AlphaSense.
AlphaSense was created on March 8, 2011. It was founded by Jack Koko. Due to the inefficiencies and limitations financial professionals face when dealing with search tools to analyze vast amounts of financial data, the idea of AlphaSense came about.  The company has received over $225 million in a series of round funding which include Seed funding and Angel investing.
	Being a search tool as well as a marketplace for financial technology analysis the company’s focus is to overcome the time consumed for research, risk management, help aid in better decision making on investments, and providing an efficient filter for vast data. All financial professionals such as portfolio managers, analysts, and researchers are the target customers of AlphaSense. NLP & AI technology are being used in AlphaSense. This technology gives them the ability to deliver relevant contextual and actionable financial information efficiently but quickly. This empowers their lead in the world of finance.
	AlphaSense has a significant role in the informational and market services within the financial & technology domain. The transformation of real time data research, high level cloud base solutions for storing data, and executing trade at lighten speeds has been the major trends and innovation of this domain over the last five to ten years. There are dozens of companies which are in the same domain as AlphaSense such as: S & P Global, Bloomberg LP, Klue, Crunchbase, Morningstar, Semrush, and Cision Communication Cloud just to name a few.
	Growth in businesses, more cost-effective operations, AI driven solutions, ESG integration, data security, and fast-paced environments that assist in better investing decisions has been the company impact. Even though the metrics varies on companies’ goals and business model. But the core metrices are the market intelligence, annual revenue generated, the volume of data processed, and the level of security provided. AlphaSense has been rated the leader of search and market intelligence by The Forrester Wave. Due to them reaching the highest score across 13 criteria’s that included AI, Vision, Internal sources, and more. 
	Based on some reviews of the company, I would advise the company to categorize their data on its search engine by most reliable to least reliable. Due to the large amount of data that is processed while searching.  Using a data Validation to filter data by accuracy and most valuable.
